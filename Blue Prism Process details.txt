High-Level Process Explanation
Initiate Process and Retrieve Data:

1.) Start Process:
The Blue Prism process starts by triggering an automated workflow. This can be scheduled to run at specific times or initiated by a user.

2.) Access Shared Drive:
  a.) The robot navigates to a shared drive location where the necessary data files are stored.
  b.) Read Data Files:
  Using Blue Prism's file management capabilities, the robot opens and reads data from the specified files (e.g., Excel sheets, CSV files).
  Extract relevant data fields required for subsequent steps.

3.) Launch Websites and Fetch Data:

  a.) Open Browser:
  The robot launches a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Internet Explorer) using Blue Prism's web automation tools.
  b.) Navigate to Websites:
  It navigates to the specified URLs of the websites from which data needs to be fetched.
  c.) Login (if required):
  The robot performs login operations if the websites require authentication. This involves entering usernames, passwords, and handling any two-factor authentication if needed.
  d.) Fetch Data:
  The robot interacts with the web pages, filling out forms, clicking buttons, and extracting the required data from the website.
  Data scraping techniques are used to capture the information displayed on the web pages.

4.) Download PDF Files:

  a.) Locate Download Links:
  The robot identifies the links or buttons on the website that trigger the download of PDF files.
  b.) Initiate Download:
  It clicks on these links/buttons to download the PDF files to a predefined location on the local machine or shared drive.
  c.) Verify Downloads:
  The robot ensures that the PDF files have been downloaded correctly and checks their integrity.
  
5.) Merge PDF Files:

  a.) Open PDF Files:
  Using Python language, the robot opens each downloaded PDF file.
  b.) Merge all PDF files:
  It merges all the pdf fiels into single pdf file.
  c.) Data Validation:
  The extracted data is validated to ensure accuracy and completeness.
  
6.) Upload Data to SAP Portal:

  a.) Launch SAP Portal:
  The robot opens the SAP application/portal using Blue Prism's application automation capabilities.
  b.) Login to SAP:
  It logs into the SAP system with the necessary credentials.
  c.) Navigate to Appropriate Module:
  The robot navigates through the SAP interface to the specific module or section where the data needs to be uploaded.
  d.) Enter Data:
  It inputs the extracted data into the relevant fields in the SAP system. This could involve filling out forms, updating records, or creating new entries.
  e.) Upload Files:
  If required, the robot uploads the downloaded and processed PDF files into the SAP portal.
  f.) Save and Confirm:
  The robot saves the changes and confirms that the data has been uploaded successfully.

7.) End Process and Generate Reports:

  a.) Generate Logs and Reports:
  The robot generates logs and reports of the entire process, documenting each step, any errors encountered, and the final status.
  b.) Notify Stakeholders:
  It sends notifications to the relevant stakeholders (via email or other communication channels) about the completion of the process, along with the generated reports.
  c.) Close Applications:
  The robot gracefully closes all opened applications and browsers, ensuring no resources are left hanging.
